## Description

## Notes
* Before running this application, please be sure that the latest version of Google Chrome is installed on your machine.
* The code in 'mission_to_mars.ipynb' uses `headless=False`, so a Chrome window will open temporarily while scraping. `headless=True` is used in the web app, so a secondary window will not run.
* After clicking the 'Scrape New Data' button, please allow a few seconds for the scraping to complete before the website reloads.
